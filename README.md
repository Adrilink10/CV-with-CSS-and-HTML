# CV-with-CSS-and-HTML
Project analysis:
- Target User Profile: The target user profile will be the companies that are interested in my skills or the experience that i have, to work for them or recommend me to other similar jobs. The information of my CV is short and clear, you can see all te information with one check.
  
- Inofrmation Architecture: All the information must be very clear, you can do it in more than one page but if you do it like this, it will be more complicated to understand and read the information.
  
- Visual design: I decided to design my curriculum mixing my own one and other cv that I saw on the internet. I used only 2 types of color, white and blue, because I wanted a good and minimalistic style. The main colors for the texts are grey, white, blue, and black, to make a good contrast between the diferent sections of the cv. I used a basic typography because I feel that is very familiar to everyone and I wanted to make it "easy" to read it, and in my opinon I achived it. The main titles are put in bold, because the user's eyes go directly there and are easier to read.

In conclusion, I think that the result is very good, all the elements are ordered, and the palette of colors are in harmony.

Thanks to this project I learend about HTML and CSS, and now I'm interested in them.
